# Groups

## Auth service
For grouping Mainflux entities there are `groups` object in the `auth` service. Grouping of entities can be done for `things` and `users` but additionally you can use `groups` for grouping some external entities as well. Groups are organized like a tree, group can have one parent and children. Group with no parent is root of the tree.


## Create a group
```bash
curl -is -S -X POST http://localhost/groups -d '{"name":"<group_name>","description":"<group_description>","parent_id":"<parent_id>","metadata":<group_metadata>}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $TOK"                    
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: nginx/1.16.0
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 08:02:02 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location
```

* **group_name** - name of the group
* **group_description** - description of group up to 1024 characters.
* **parent_id** - id of parent group, if not specified created group is tree root.
* **metadata** - custom metadata that can be attached to group object for specific application needs.
  
## Fetch a group
```bash
curl -s -S -X GET http://localhost/groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2 -H "Authorization: $TOK" 
```
                                                                           

## Create a child

```bash
curl -is -S -X POST http://localhost/groups -d '{"name":"test1","description":"<group_description>","parent_id":"01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2","metadata":{"group_attr":"attr_value"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $TOK" 
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: nginx/1.16.0

Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /groups/01F2TTVV5NJH63FE5KXMNPWB8P

```

## Fetch a child group

```bash
curl -s -S -X GET http://localhost/groups/01F2TTVV5NJH63FE5KXMNPWB8P -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq
{
  "id": "01F2TTVV5NJH63FE5KXMNPWB8P",
  "name": "test1",
  "owner_id": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
  "parent_id": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2",
  "description": "group for test",
  "metadata": {
    "group_attr": "attr_value"
  },
  "level": 1,
  "created_at": "2021-04-09T08:09:37.718Z",
  "updated_at": "2021-04-09T08:09:37.718Z"
}
```

* **owner_id** - is attached by service, it is id of the user that issued create request.
* **level** - is generated by service, it represents a level in a tree hierarchy
* **created_at** - time of creation, generated by service.
* **updated_at** - time of update, generated by service.

## Fetch group hierarchy

To fetch a group hierarchy you can either fetch children for a group or a direct ascendant line
### Fetch a parent
```bash
 curl -s -S -X GET http://localhost/groups/<group_id>/parents?tree=true&level=5 -H "Authorization: <auth_token>" | jq
{
  "total": 2,
  "level": 1,
  "name": "",
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2",
      "name": "test",
      "owner_id": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
      "description": "group for test",
      "metadata": {
        "group_attr": "attr_value"
      },
      "level": 1,
      "path": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "01F2TTVV5NJH63FE5KXMNPWB8P",
          "name": "test1",
          "owner_id": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
          "parent_id": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2",
          "description": "group for test",
          "metadata": {
            "group_attr": "attr_value"
          },
          "level": 2,
          "path": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2.01F2TTVV5NJH63FE5KXMNPWB8P",
          "created_at": "2021-04-09T08:09:37.718Z",
          "updated_at": "2021-04-09T08:09:37.718Z"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2021-04-09T08:02:02.389Z",
      "updated_at": "2021-04-09T08:02:02.389Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
* **tree** - if true response is JSON that represent a groups tree structure. If ommited or `false` than groups will be retrieve as list
* **level** - limits the hierarchy to be retrieved. Max level to be fetched in one request is 5.
  
### Fetch children

```bash
curl -s -S -X GET http://localhost/groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2/children\?tree\=true\&level\=5 -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq
{
  "total": 3,

    }
  ]
}
```

## Assign a member to a group
You can assign members to a group by putting entity ids into a group
For example assigning users to a group
```bash
curl -isSX POST http://localhost/groups/<group_id>/members -d '{"members":["<user_id1>",..."<user_idN>"],"type":"users"}' -H "Authorization: $TOK" -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.0
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 09:40:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location
```
Or assigning things to a group

```bash
curl -isSX POST http://localhost/groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2/members -d '{"members":["a0b1d516-67c6-4e8d-8ea2-ad4aff444ca3","9a036414-5d47-4122-9e58-b3b6953a2097"],"type":"things"}' -H "Authorization: $TOK" -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.0
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 09:43:24 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location
```

To fetch members you can use endpoint on `auth`, `things` or `users` service. Endpoint on auth service only retrieves member ids. Endpoints on `things` and `users` will retrieve full objects.

## Fetching members

### Fetching from `auth` service
```bash
curl -sSX GET http://localhost/groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2/members  -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq
{
  "limit": 10,
  "total": 0,
  "name": "",
  "Members": [
    {
      "ID": "5ec9f5f4-5221-43f4-a56f-9594ab110efa",
      "Type": "users"
    },
    {
      "ID": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
      "Type": "users"
    },
    {
      "ID": "a0b1d516-67c6-4e8d-8ea2-ad4aff444ca3",
      "Type": "things"
    },
    {
      "ID": "9a036414-5d47-4122-9e58-b3b6953a2097",
      "Type": "things"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can filter by `type`
```bash
curl -sSX GET http://localhost/groups/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2/members\?type\='users'  -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq
{
  "limit": 10,
  "total": 2,
  "level": 0,
  "name": "",
  "Members": [
    {
      "ID": "5ec9f5f4-5221-43f4-a56f-9594ab110efa",
      "Type": "users"
    },
    {
      "ID": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
      "Type": "users"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Fetching from `users` service

```
curl -sSX GET http://localhost/groups/users/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2  -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq        
{
  "total": 2,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10,
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "5ec9f5f4-5221-43f4-a56f-9594ab110efa",
      "email": "admin@example.com"
    },
    {
      "id": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
      "email": "moko@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Fetching from `things` service
```
 curl -sSX GET http://localhost/groups/things/01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2  -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq
{
  "total": 2,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10,
  "order": "",
  "direction": "",
  "things": [
    {
      "id": "a0b1d516-67c6-4e8d-8ea2-ad4aff444ca3",
      "key": "54dfc44c-3471-4903-a6b5-529dc7a2dd41"
    },
    {
      "id": "9a036414-5d47-4122-9e58-b3b6953a2097",
      "key": "e874fc75-461d-4ece-ac55-2d7cdc10c20a"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Fetching membership

For entity that is being put in multiple groups it is possible to retrieve a list of groups it belongs to.

```bash
curl -sSX GET http://localhost/members/<member_id>/groups  -H "Authorization: $TOK" | jq 
{
  "total": 1,
  "level": 0,
  "name": "",
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "01F2TTDYGMP6DW083NE6E0DKH2",
      "name": "test",
      "owner_id": "8e968002-1b19-4e17-bfb6-f0064888a2d1",
      "description": "group for test",
      "metadata": {
        "group_attr": "attr_value"
      },
      "level": 0,
      "path": "",
      "created_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **member_id** - is either thing or user id, or some other enitity if groups are being used for grouping external entities.
